# Kant

> There is ... only a single categorical imperative and it is this: Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law

-- Immanuel Kant, Metaphysics of Morals (1797), Ch. 11

## A Monochrome Color Scheme

Kant is a monochrome color scheme for JetBrains editors like Intellij IDEA Ultimate and PyCharm.

It is based on the luxurious monochrome color schemes Verdandi and Verdandi Alter for Visual Studio Code.
